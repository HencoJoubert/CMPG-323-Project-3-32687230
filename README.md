# CMPG-323-Project-3-32687230

Project Description:
We are given an existing ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application that will need to be enhanced and improved by implementing coding principles as well as design patterns.
This project represents a work scenario where are not asked to create a project but rather given an existing one to change as required.
In this project we learn about repositories (why and how to use them).
